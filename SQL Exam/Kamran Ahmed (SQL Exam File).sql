-- 1. Write a SQL query which will sort out the customer and their grade
-- who made an order. Every customer must have a grade and be served
-- by at least one seller, who belongs to a region.

from customer a, orders_ex b, salesman_ex c
where a.customer_id = b.customer_id
and b.salesman_id=c.salesman_id

group by salesman having count(a.salesman)>=1;


-- 2. Write a query for extracting the data from the order table for the
-- salesman who earned the maximum commission.

from orders_ex a right join salesman_ex b
